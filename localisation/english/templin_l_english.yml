 START_SCREEN_GTU:0 "Over a century ago we paid for our future in blood. Every bullet fired, every bomb dropped, every tank, aircraft, and warship which had unleashed its weapons in anger was a declaration to the universe. There is no power that cannot be shattered by our collective will, no enemy that will deny us our place in the universe, no cause too great that human flesh and human steel will not rise to meet it. A century ago our forefathers fought the right to exist. Citizens, I ask you, who among us was not humbled by their magnificent sacrifice?\n\nFor many years we have worked to earn that sacrifice. We have sought reward in service alone. The path we chose was not an easy one. But never once have we faltered, for in our struggle we have come to understand that the galaxy does not permit the survival of the weak and the timid.\n\nAnd so today, as ships and armies march forward under the banner of our great nation, they carry with them a sacred fire that a century ago was lit in the heart of all mankind. Soon that fire will blaze across the stars and should any stand against us, that fire will burn their fields and boil their oceans until their mountains crack and every hope is burned to ash! The entire galaxy will know, if we cannot move heaven, we shall raise hell!"
 START_SCREEN_ANTARES:0 "Over two centuries ago, fate, destiny or simple chance took from our ancestors the lives they had worked towards, the lives they deserved. We stand here today not on the world they expected, but on many. Each cared out from an unforgiving wilderness by those who refused to allow their circumstances define them. For decades and centuries those who came before dedicated their lives to make our star system a better home for those that would come after. We struggled alone until the day we could again work together. I can fit of a no more fitting tribute to the brave pioneers of the Earhart Flotilla, that the ship that now bears their name will leave the boundaries of this system, not under the flags of one of our republics, but of that, of our shared nation. For as we embark on the greatest, most dangerous adventure in our history, we carry with us only the goodwill of the Confederate Republics of Antares, but all those who perished before this nation and this day might arrive."
