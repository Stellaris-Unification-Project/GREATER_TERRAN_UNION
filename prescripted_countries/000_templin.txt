		With human civilization on the brink of total collapse, the measures taken to preserve what little remained were brutal and at times, cruel. Amidst famine, poverty, and despair however, there awoke a new sense of purpose and responsibility. When global order was restored, humanity placed their faith in the coalition and this emergency provisional government reorganized itself into the Greater Terran Union.
		
		The petty conflicts and divisions that for millennia splintered humanity have now been burned away. The swords of man are united; the Tyrum, and the galaxy, will tremble at their might."

Their technology is not their own, taken from the so called “Old Ones” although the relationship between the Tyrum and this long dead civilization is not understood. 

Whatever their origins, they exist today as a cancer eating away at the galaxy. "

When they finally reunited with one another, each Republic agreed to participate in a loose confederacy, one charged with breaking beyond the boundaries of the strange region they found themselves within and return to their homeworld of Earth."
